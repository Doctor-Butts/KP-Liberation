FEATURES:

ACE Default Loadouts are implemented
Spend less time gearing up your character and more time fighting. A number of basic and specialized loadouts are available in the ACE Arsenal/Default Loadouts screen for you to choose. Not ONLY does choosing a loadout give you the gear, but it also changes your ACE class. For instance, if you choose the 'Combat Medic' role, it give you medic abiliies. Same for 'Engineer'.
Instead of inflating the mission.sqm file for this, and making it tough to edit, it  has been put into a different area.

Limited but fair Arsenal
If there's one thing people don't like seeing in a sandbox mission are people spending hours Barbie Boxing and not helping out in the fight. The Arsenal is limited, but can still be customized. This also means it's less time making decisions on whether you should pick one of 18 varieties of 5.56 ammo that's compatible with your gun.

CBA Settings is implemented
This allows the server/mission to force some ACE Addon settings for all clients. Makes it easier for mission makers to tweak settings.

ACE Fortify is implemented
Allows engineers/those with proper tools to build small obstacles

BI's dynamic groups are implemented
If do not want to use the ACE grouping, this is available as well. Makes it easier to join a team at great distances.


Extra Options at Base and FOB's in Middle Mouse menu

	1. The KP Loadout is nice, but it can be cumbersome if you just want to get to an Arsenal and change things. This version of the mission has an ACE arsenal option that takes you directly to the ACE arsenal.

	2. Quick options to add specialized attachments for fighting at night time or if you want to use suppressed weapons. Compatible with the Default Loadouts.
	The "Night Gear" script will add the laser pointer to your gun, NVG's to your player, and an IR strobe in your uniform.
	The "Silent Gear" script will add a suppressor to your gun, if possible.

	3. Whitelist options.
	whitelists allow you to give some players more options.
	In this version, the whitelist allows certain players to not only have access to change permissions, but also some special middle mouse menu items.
	Currently, the options are to: Give a supply crate, increase rep, increase intel.
	
	4. Make Me a....
	Not only does your 'class' change if you choose the Default Loadout, you can also choose it here if  you need to change roles mid mission.

TO DO:
1. Make a whitelisted arsenal for certain players. Gives them the ability to use a greater range of arsenal items
